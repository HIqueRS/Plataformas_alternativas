Dream Stone and Dark Stone, slightly Brawl-styled

Model and all textures made from scratch by Peardian using Cinema 4D and Fireworks.


Info:
I made these as props for my Brawl-style Antasma model.
Their scale is based loosely on how large the Dream Stone appears in the game compared to Mario and Antasma.

I have never done any Brawl hacking, nor do I know how. Please don't ask me to help you.
